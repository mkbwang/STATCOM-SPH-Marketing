Question 4: How easy is it to find the application and application requirements?(numeric) {data-navmenu="Open Surveys"}
===================================== 


Column
-------------------------------------

### Distribution of All the scores

```{r}
elements_open_Q4 = readRDS("results/Open_Q4.rds")

```


### Distribution of Scores in Different Affiliations

```{r}
ggplotly(elements_open_Q4$stratify_plot)
```


Column
-------------------------------------

### Interpretation

The distribution of scores from Master's students appears very similar to the distribution of scores from Undergraduate students. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test was carried out to test if these distributions are the same. This test yielded a p-value of 0.5558, which suggests the scores do not differ significantly between Master's and Undergraduate students (since the p-value is greater than the 0.05 significance level).

| Research Areas/Areas of Study |    <0.0001     |

Table: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Results. A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that the ranks are symmetric around the middle value of 4.5. 

**Interpretation**: Research Areas, Degree Requirements, Career Outcomes, and Department-Specific Information were ranked as the most important considerations when applying to Michigan Public Health. Location, Faculty, and Student Life tended to be ranked lower in terms of importance. Financial Aid received a fairly even mix of high and low rankings, and the results of the Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Tests suggest that it is the only category with ranks symmetric around the middle value of 4.5. 


### Responses by Student Affiliation

| Category | P-Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| Location |     0.2175   |
| Faculty Information |    0.0312     |

| Career Outcomes |    0.0003    |
| Degree Requirements |    0.2121    |
| Research Areas/Areas of Study |    0.2234     |

Table: Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test Results. A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that there are no significant differences between the Undergraduate and Master's student rankings. 

**Interpretation**: Undergraduate students rank Career Outcomes and Student Life as significantly more important than Master's students do. Master's students rank Faculty Information and Department-Specific Information as significantly more important than Undergraduate students do. This is observed in both the figure and the Wilcoxon Ranked-Sum Tests.

Students replied that degree requirements were the most important to them, followed by career outcomes, research areas/areas of study, financial aid, and department specific information. Student life and faculty information often ranked below a 4.

This analysis changes when we look at the student's affiliation. 
Career outcomes were more important to Master's students than undergraduates, as were degree requirements and department-specific information.
Faculty information was about equally important to undergraduates and Master's students.
Financial aid information was more important to undergraduates than Master's students, as were research areas/areas of study and student life.

Degree requirements, career outcomes, and department-specific information were the most important factors to Master's students.
Student life and faculty information were the least important to Master's students.

Research areas/areas of study, financial aid, degree requirements were the most important factors to undergraduates.
Student life, faculty information, and department-specific information were the least important factors to undergraduates.
